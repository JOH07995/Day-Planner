# Day-Planner
a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.



Key considerations in this effort and unit are:
* Using BootStrap for the look and feel
* jQuery
* DOM traversal and manipulation
* Event handling
* the concept of *this*
* data-* attributes
